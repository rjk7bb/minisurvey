<h1>Congratulations on Completing the Situation Room Experience! Before you debrief with the other participants, we want you to answer a few quick questions about your experience. Please answer these questions without talking to others. Aside from helping people learn about political policies and judgments, the Situation Room Experience can also shed light on more general aspects concerning how people perceive others, and how groups work together to make decisions. Later, weâ€™ll use the answers you provide to learn about some psychological principles at play during the simulation. </h1>
